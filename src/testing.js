							A master manipulator of software! You have truly conquered <br></br> the art of non-conformity
							and having code bend to your <br></br> vision and will! The type to give textbook traditions
							the <br></br> middle finger and ruthlessly banish old browsers for <br></br> modern up to date ones.
							This type of developer may not <br></br> sepearate their HTML and CSS content, not consider
							<br></br> their fellow team-mates in keeping their code universally <br></br> easy to follow and perhaps
							break all trust by relentless <br></br> office back-stabbing on their 'climb' to the top! <br></br>
							Allbeit a superb and savvy developer!

							Another sucker for the old school...These are no suckers pardon my <br></br>  English, they're as tough as they come!!
							A stern gaze and steely <br></br> manner make up   these folk...and usually loads of greys (full of <br></br> wisdom of course).
							Usually found spearheading the company - on <br></br> the board of directors or owning the joint, these guys are
							tunneled <br></br> in their vision and zealous in ambition! Although they do exercise <br></br> tradition and are quite
							intolerable to newer technologies/concepts <br></br> like React and AI, naturally preferring remote work  (as they're <br></br>
							lone wolves through and through) with a rusty desktop that does <br></br> the job. They refuse to take blame or
							extend their name <br></br> alongside percieved failures as their reputation is their world! <br></br>
							Remember to smile and be nice...we've all seen what happens to you <br></br> in the series.;

							They prefer Java to <br></br> JavaScript cause of it's strict and set structure, <br></br> untrusting of any new technology, 
							opting to stick to <br></br> HTML 3.0 and Bootstrap 2.0! They more or less <br></br> breathe depreciation! They are however
							great in their <br></br> chosen fields - whether it's client-side, server-side, <br></br> full-stack etc and will get the 
							job done! Even if it is <br></br> a blast from the past and takes 40 lines of definite,<br></br> solidified code rather

							A terrific salesman - particularly of self, they shine bright and are proud people. They know their value 
							and won't accept a penny less for their efforts. Always on the hustle and look out for the next role (be 
							it with their current employer or another) they make machine learning and languages such as Malbolge look
							adequate for toddlers! This developer is quick to share their knowledge on Stack Overflow and other forums 
							and eager to adopt a junior (tending to love the sound of their own voices). Ohhh, they're also creating
							their own software...

							Ohh, what an oddball indeed...these 'creatures' are found in their lairs keenly engulfing the JavaScript secrets or
							at the rear of web seminars intently devouring info and feeding their bottomless thirst for knowledge - 
							particularly the dark arts. Master strategists it must be said but wierdly aberrant and introverted. These developers
							will be alone, they prefer their workmates to let them get on with it and flourish in languages such as BrainF**k and
							C++. They're not quite as recognized for their efforts as they'd like or even deserve but their awkward social
							display and coffee-stained ripped black hoodie are something of a repeller. They secretly wish for a friend, a hug
							and an 'F YOU!' to the world 'if' they rise to the top...
