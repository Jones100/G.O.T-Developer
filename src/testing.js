					Ohh, what an oddball indeed...these 'creatures' are found in their lairs keenly engulfing the JavaScript secrets or
					at the rear of web seminars intently devouring info and feeding their bottomless thirst for knowledge - 
					particularly the dark arts. Master strategists it must be said but wierdly aberrant and introverted. These developers
					will be alone, they prefer their workmates to let them get on with it and flourish in languages such as BrainF**k and
					C++. They're not quite as recognized for their efforts as they'd like or even deserve but their awkward social
					display and coffee-stained ripped black hoodie are something of a repeller. They secretly wish for a friend, a hug
					and an 'F YOU!' to the world 'if' they rise to the top...
