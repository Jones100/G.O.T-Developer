							A master manipulator of software! You have truly <br></br> conquered the art of non-conformity
							and having code <br></br> bend to your vision and will! The type to give textbook <br></br> traditions
							the middle finger and ruthlessly banish old <br></br> browsers for modern up to date ones.
							This type of <br></br> developer may not sepearate their HTML and CSS <br></br> content, not consider
							their fellow team-mates in <br></br> keeping their code universally easy to follow and <br></br> perhaps
							break all trust by relentless office <br></br> back-stabbing on their 'climb' to the top! <br></br>
							Allbeit a superb and savvy developer!

							Another sucker for the old school...These are no suckers pardon my <br></br>  English, they're as tough as they come!!
							A stern gaze and steely <br></br> manner make up   these folk...and usually loads of greys (full of <br></br> wisdom of course).
							Usually found spearheading the company - on <br></br> the board of directors or owning the joint, these guys are
							tunneled <br></br> in their vision and zealous in ambition! Although they do exercise <br></br> tradition and are quite
							intolerable to newer technologies/concepts <br></br> like React and AI, naturally preferring remote work  (as they're <br></br>
							lone wolves through and through) with a rusty desktop that does <br></br> the job. They refuse to take blame or
							extend their name <br></br> alongside percieved failures as their reputation is their world! <br></br>
							Remember to smile and be nice...we've all seen what happens to you <br></br> in the series.;

							They prefer Java to <br></br> JavaScript cause of it's strict and set structure, <br></br> untrusting of any new technology, 
							opting to stick to <br></br> HTML 3.0 and Bootstrap 2.0! They more or less <br></br> breathe depreciation! They are however
							great in their <br></br> chosen fields - whether it's client-side, server-side, <br></br> full-stack etc and will get the 
							job done! Even if it is <br></br> a blast from the past and takes 40 lines of definite,<br></br> solidified code rather

							A terrific salesman - particularly of self, <br></br> they shine bright and are proud people. They know their value 
							and <br></br> won't accept a penny less for their efforts. Always on the hustle and <br></br> look out for the next role (be 
							it with their current employer or another) <br></br> they make machine learning and languages such as Malbolge look <br></br> 
							adequate for toddlers! This developer is quick to share their knowledge <br></br> on Stack Overflow and other forums 
							and eager to adopt a junior <br></br> (tending to love the sound of their own voices). Ohhh, they're <br></br> also creating
							their own software...

							at the rear <br></br> of web seminars intently devouring info and feeding their <br></br> bottomless thirst for knowledge - 
							particularly the dark arts. <br></br> Master strategists it must be said but wierdly aberrant and <br></br> introverted. These developers
							will be alone, they prefer their <br></br> workmates to let them get on with it  and flourish in languages <br></br> such as BrainF**k and
							C++. They're not quite as recognized <br></br> for their efforts as they'd like or even deserve but their awkward <br></br> social
							display and coffee-stained ripped black hoodie are <br></br> something of a repeller. They secretly wish for a friend, a hug
							and <br></br> an 'F YOU!' to the world 'if' they rise to the top...
