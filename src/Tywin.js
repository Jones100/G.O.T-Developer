				Another sucker for the old school...These are no suckers pardon my English, they're as tough as they come!!
				A stern gaze and steely manner make up these folk...and usually loads of greys (full of wisdom of course). 
				Usually found spearheading the company - on the board of directors or owning the joint, these guys are
				tunneled in their vision and zealous in ambition! Although they do exercise tradition and are quite
				intolerable to newer technologies/concepts like React and AI, naturally preferring remote work (as they're
				lone wolves through and through) with a rusty desktop that does the job. They refuse to take blame or
				extend their name alongside percieved failures as their reputation is their world! 
				Remember to smile and be nice...we've all what happens to you in the series :-);
