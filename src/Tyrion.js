					opting to stick to HTML 3.0 and Bootstrap 2.0! They more or less breathe depreciation! They are however
					great in their chosen fields - whether it's client-side, server-side, full-stack etc and will get the 
					job done! Even if it is a blast from the past and takes 40 lines of definite, solidified code rather 
					than 20 slighly looser lines :-);
