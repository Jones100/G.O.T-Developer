					The epitome of creativity, uniqueness and sheer brilliance! This confident character knows all the tricks!
					A terrific salesman - particularly of self, they shine bright and are proud people. They know their value 
					and won't accept a penny less for their efforts. Always on the hustle and look out for the next role (be 
					it with their current employer or another) they make machine learning and languages such as Malbolge look
					adequate for toddlers! This developer is quick to share their knowledge on Stack Overflow and other forums 
					and eager to adopt a junior (tending to love the sound of their own voices). Ohhh, they're also creating
					their own software... 
					Hail Tyrion!
