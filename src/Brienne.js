							Enter Brienne...protector of the laws of web development, loyal <br></br> to their teammates almost to a fault,
							unwavering in their bold <br></br> &#160; and rigid path to serve humanity and deliver clean, tried <br></br> &#160; and tested code!
							They prefer Java to JavaScript cause <br></br> &#160; of it's strict and set structure, untrusting of any new <br></br> &#160;&#160; &#160; technology,
							opting to stick to HTML 3.0 and <br></br> &#160; &#160;&#160; &#160;&#160; &#160; Bootstrap 2.0! They more or less breathe <br></br>
							&#160; &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#160;&#160; depreciation! They are however great in their <br></br> &#160; &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#160;&#160; &#160; chosen fields -
							whether it's client-side, <br></br>&#160; &#160;&#160; &#160;&#160; &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; server-side,full-stack etc and will get the job <br></br> &#160; &#160;&#160; &#160;&#160; &#160;&#160; &#160; done! Even if it is a blast from the past and
							<br></br> &#160; &#160;&#160; &#160;&#160; &#160;&#160; &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; takes 40 lines of definite, solidified code <br></br>&#160; &#160;&#160; &#160;&#160; &#160;&#160; &#160;&#160; &#160;&#160;&#160; rather than 20 slighly looser lines :-);
